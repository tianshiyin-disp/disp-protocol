## 愿景 | About DISP
DISP is a new, Web3-based, intention-driven protocol that enables any intent, however minor, to be deeply understood, responded to, and fulfilled. It marks a paradigm shift from "people finding services" to "services finding people," returning economic sovereignty to each individual.

Our mission is to use code and cryptography to establish a global protocol without mandatory intermediaries or value barriers, allowing services to flow freely. We are forging the very cornerstone of the next-generation internet.

This repository hosts the core documents, technical whitepapers, and cultural keystones of the DISP project during its genesis phase.
